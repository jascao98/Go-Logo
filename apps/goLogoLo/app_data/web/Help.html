        <p>The application has many features for how you want to customize your logos.
            On the left side, there holds logo information in a chart that the user can move up, down, and edit.

            and change the font, gradient and color of the logo components. Finally, on the top of the application holds the standard toolbar
            which hold functions such as save,export,zoom in and etc..<br /><br /></p>

            give your file a name, which does not necessarily have to be the same
            as the name you specified in the name text field.<br /><br /></p>
